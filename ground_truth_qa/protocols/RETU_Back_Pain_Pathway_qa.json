      "question": "What are the absolute contraindications for RETU admission in patients with back pain?",

      "question": "What is the first-line treatment approach for back pain in RETU?",
      "answer": "First-line treatment includes APAP 650mg every 6 hours and NSAIDs (Motrin 600mg every 6 hours or Ketorolac 15mg every 6 hours). These can be used with or without muscle relaxants (Valium 5-10mg every 8 hours) and topical agents (Lidocaine 5% patch 1-2 every 12 hours).",

      "question": "What are the age-specific morphine dosing guidelines for back pain in RETU?",
      "answer": "For morphine IV initial dose: patients over 65 years old receive 4mg, while patients under 65 years old receive 6mg. If pain is controlled after 30 minutes, continue the same morphine dose every 3 hours as needed.",

      "question": "How should Dilaudid be dosed for back pain patients in RETU?",
      "answer": "Dilaudid IV dosing is weight-based: for patients over 65 years old, give 0.01 mg/kg, and for patients under 65 years old, give 0.02 mg/kg. If effective, continue the same dilaudid dose every 3 hours as needed.",

      "question": "What is the escalation pathway if first and second-line treatments fail for back pain?",
      "answer": "If oral medications and initial IV opioids fail to control pain after 30 minutes, proceed to third-line IV opiates (morphine or dilaudid every 3 hours). If pain remains uncontrolled, fourth-line treatment involves PCA pump with Pain Service consultation.",

      "question": "What neurologic examination components are emphasized for back pain patients in RETU?",
      "answer": "The examination should focus on neurologic and vascular components. Particular attention should be paid to identifying any progressive neurologic deficits or changes in neurological examination that would warrant admission.",

      "question": "What are the criteria for discharge from RETU for back pain patients?",
