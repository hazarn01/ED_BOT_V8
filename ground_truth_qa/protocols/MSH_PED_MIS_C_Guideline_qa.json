      "question": "What are the vasopressor recommendations for children with MIS-C presenting with different types of shock?",
      "answer": "For septic/vasodilatory shock (flash capillary refill, warm extremities): norepinephrine infusion at 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min after 60mL/kg isotonic fluids. For cardiogenic shock (poor capillary refill, cool extremities): epinephrine infusion at 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min, with cautious fluid boluses at 10mL/kg. Epinephrine and dopamine are acceptable alternatives. Source: MSH PED MIS-C Guideline.pdf",
