      "question": "What are the five components of the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) and their scoring criteria?",
      "answer": "The PRAM has 5 components: 1) Suprasternal Retractions (0=absent, 2=present), 2) Scalene Muscle Contraction (0=absent, 2=present), 3) Air Entry (0=normal, 1=decreased at base, 2=diffusely decreased, 3=absent/minimal), 4) Wheezing (0=absent, 1=expiratory only, 2=inspiratory and expiratory, 3=audible without stethoscope/minimal air entry), 5) Oxygen Saturation (0=≥95% RA and no O2, 1=92-94% RA and no O2, 3=<92% RA or on O2). Total score ranges 0-12.",

      "answer": "For a 20 kg child (15-25 kg weight range): 6 puffs MDI or 5 mg nebulized. For continuous albuterol via nebulizer, since the child is ≥20 kg, the dose would be 15 mg/hr. The dosing is weight-based: <15kg gets 4 puffs MDI/2.5mg neb, 15-25kg gets 6 puffs MDI/5mg neb, ≥25kg gets 8 puffs MDI/7.5mg neb.",

      "question": "What is the dexamethasone dosing for a 12 kg pediatric patient, and how does it compare to prednisone equivalence?",
      "answer": "For a 12 kg pediatric patient: Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg = 7.2 mg (oral/IM), with a maximum dose of 16 mg. Two days of dexamethasone is equivalent to 5 days of prednisone/prednisolone. This makes dexamethasone a convenient alternative with fewer doses required for the same therapeutic effect.",

      "answer": "PRAM 1-3: Albuterol + ipratropium (max 3 doses back to back), consider corticosteroid. PRAM 4-7: Albuterol + ipratropium (max 3 doses back to back), corticosteroid. PRAM 8-12: Albuterol + ipratropium (3 doses back to back), continuous or q1H albuterol, corticosteroid, magnesium. Consider terbutaline, epinephrine, BiPAP/HFNC for severe cases.",

      "question": "What is the magnesium sulfate dosing for pediatric asthma and when should it be considered?",
      "answer": "Magnesium sulfate dosing: 50-75 mg/kg (maximum 2g) given IV over 20 minutes. For example, a 25 kg child would receive 1.25-1.875g (using the max of 2g). Magnesium should be considered for PRAM 8-12 (severe asthma), patients requiring continuous albuterol, and as part of the escalation pathway for refractory cases.",

EXCLUDE: Children <2 years, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, airway anomalies, history of arrhythmias or heart disease, immune disorder, sickle cell disease. These exclusions ensure the pathway is used only for appropriate asthma cases without complicating comorbidities.",

Terbutaline IV: Bolus 2-10mcg/kg over 10 min (if >50kg, max 5mcg/kg), followed by continuous 0.08-0.4mcg/kg/min, titrate every 30 min. For a 30 kg child: SQ dose would be 0.15-0.3 mg.",

PRAM 8-12 = Admit to PICU. If patient requires continuous albuterol or q1H treatment, admit to PICU. If albuterol q2H, admit to floor. Consider BI Short Stay Unit for admissions anticipated <48h.",

Progression: Phase 2 (albuterol q2h) → Phase 3 (albuterol q3h) → Phase 4 (albuterol q4h) → Discharge. Each phase requires PRAM 1-3 after one treatment to advance. PRAM 8-12 triggers escalation/admission. Consider admission if on ED Observation >9:00 AM.",
