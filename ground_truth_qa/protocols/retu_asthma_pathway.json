      "question": "What testing is required prior to RETU admission for asthma patients?",
      "answer": "None. No specific testing is required prior to RETU admission for asthma patients.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the criteria that make a patient NOT appropriate for RETU admission?",
      "answer": "Patients are not appropriate for RETU if they have: ventilatory support required, peak flow <40% of predicted after ED treatment, oxygen sat <92%, or respiratory distress after ED treatment (at least 3 albuterol nebs).",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should be included in the RETU intake evaluation for asthma patients?",
      "answer": "RETU intake evaluation includes: Exam Focus on Pulmonary and Cardiac systems, Initial Testing with Labs as clinically indicated, Imaging with CXR, ECG as clinically indicated. Do not repeat testing if already done in ED.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What monitoring should be performed for asthma patients in RETU?",
      "answer": "Monitoring includes: pulse ox as indicated, peak flow after each neb treatment.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "When should pulmonary consultation be considered for RETU asthma patients?",
      "answer": "Pulmonary consultation should be considered as clinically indicated for asthma patients in RETU.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the treatment protocol for Phase 1 (RETU hour 1-6) of the asthma pathway?",
      "answer": "Phase 1 treatment includes: nebulized albuterol Q 3 hours, nebulized ipratropium Q 6 hours, prednisone (if not given in ED), consider magnesium/terbutaline if not improving.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the treatment protocol for Phase 2 (RETU hour 7-24) of the asthma pathway?",
      "answer": "Phase 2 treatment includes: nebulized albuterol Q 6 hours, nebulized ipratropium Q 6 hours, reassess for discharge Q 2 hours.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "When should a patient progress from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in RETU?",
      "answer": "Patients should progress from Phase 1 to Phase 2 when they are improving. If not improving, repeat Phase 1 treatment.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the criteria for discharge from RETU for asthma patients?",
      "answer": "Discharge criteria include: wheeze absent or at baseline, treatment response sustained for 1 hour, resolution of symptoms, pulse ox >92% with exertion.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the criteria for admission to hospital from RETU for asthma patients?",
      "answer": "Admission criteria include: symptoms worsening or failing to improve, pulse oximetry <92% with exertion, persistent tachypnea/respiratory distress.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should asthma patients be reassessed for discharge in Phase 2?",
      "answer": "In Phase 2, patients should be reassessed for discharge every 2 hours.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What additional treatments should be considered if a patient is not improving in Phase 1?",
      "answer": "If not improving in Phase 1, consider magnesium or terbutaline therapy.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the maximum time frame for RETU observation in the asthma pathway?",
      "answer": "The RETU asthma pathway covers up to 24 hours (Phase 1: hours 1-6, Phase 2: hours 7-24).",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "When should prednisone be given to asthma patients in RETU?",
      "answer": "Prednisone should be given in Phase 1 if it was not already given in the ED.",
      "source": "RETU Asthma Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What key clinical assessments are required before discharge from RETU?",
      "answer": "Before discharge, ensure: wheeze is absent or at baseline, treatment response is sustained for 1 hour, symptoms have resolved, and pulse oximetry is >92% with exertion.",
