      "question": "What is the dosage of aspirin required for acute MI?",
      "answer": "For acute STEMI, aspirin (ASA) 324mg should be given immediately, chewed for rapid absorption. This is part of the standard STEMI pack medications along with Brillinta 180mg, Crestor 80mg, and Heparin 4000 units IV bolus.",

      "question": "Why should aspirin be chewed in acute MI?",
      "answer": "Aspirin should be chewed in acute MI for rapid absorption and faster antiplatelet effect. Chewing aspirin (324mg) provides quicker onset of action compared to swallowing, which is critical in the first minutes of STEMI management.",
