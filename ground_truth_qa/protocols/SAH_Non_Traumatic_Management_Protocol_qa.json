      "question": "What is the preferred blood pressure target for subarachnoid hemorrhage patients and which antihypertensive agents should be used?",
      "answer": "For SAH patients, maintain SBP ≤140 mmHg using Nicardipine drip (preferred), Clevidipine drip, or Labetalol drip. Avoid nitroprusside as this can raise ICP. Also maintain SBP ≥90 mmHg with neosynephrine if needed. Source: SAH (Non-Traumatic) Managment Procotol CSC-3.pdf",

      "answer": "Nimodipine dosing for SAH: 60 mg PO q 4h for SBP≥140 mmHg, 30 mg PO q 4h for SBP 120-140 mmHg, hold for SBP ≤120 mmHg. If patient is NPO, place NGT to ensure administration. Source: SAH (Non-Traumatic) Managment Procotol CSC-3.pdf",

Continue phenytoin 300 mg IV qd after initial load, or consider switching from dilantin to Keppra 1000 mg IV BID if antiepileptics are continued.
