    },
    {
      "question": "What conditions make a COPD patient NOT appropriate for RETU admission?",
      "answer": "Patients are not appropriate for RETU if they have: High-risk active acute comorbidity (eg, pneumonia, heart failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, etc), altered mental status, or acute respiratory failure.",

    {
      "question": "What should be included in the RETU intake evaluation for COPD patients?",
      "answer": "RETU intake evaluation includes: Exam Focus on Pulmonary and Cardiac systems, Initial Testing with Labs (CBC, Chem 7, pCO2, troponin, BNP, d-dimer as indicated), Imaging (CXR). Do not repeat testing if already done in ED.",

      "question": "What is the standard treatment protocol for COPD patients in RETU?",
      "answer": "Standard treatment includes: Nebulized albuterol q2-4h + Nebulized ipratropium q4-6h + Prednisone + Antibiotics.",

      "source": "RETU COPD Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What additional testing should be considered if COPD patients are not improving?",
      "answer": "If not improving, consider pCO2, CXR, troponin, BNP, d-dimer as clinically indicated.",
      "source": "RETU COPD Pathway"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the criteria for discharge from RETU for COPD patients?",
      "answer": "Discharge criteria include: Acceptable vital signs, resolution of symptoms or return to near baseline respiratory status, return to baseline pulse oximetry or FiO2.",

      "question": "What are the criteria for admission to hospital from RETU for COPD patients?",
      "answer": "Admission criteria include: Deterioration of clinical condition or unstable vital signs, uncompensated pCO2 retention, persistent new oxygen requirement despite treatment, development of new high-risk active acute comorbidity (eg, pneumonia, heart failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, etc).",
      "source": "RETU COPD Pathway"

    {
      "question": "What discharge medications should COPD patients receive when leaving RETU?",

    {
      "question": "How often should ipratropium nebulizations be given to COPD patients in RETU?",

    {
      "question": "What key laboratory values should be monitored in COPD patients who are not improving?",
      "answer": "Key laboratory values to monitor include: pCO2 (for CO2 retention), troponin (for cardiac involvement), BNP (for heart failure), and d-dimer (for pulmonary embolism) as clinically indicated.",
