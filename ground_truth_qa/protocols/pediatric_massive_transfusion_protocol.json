      "source": "Pediatric Massive Transfusion Protocol"
    },
    {
      "question": "When is cryoprecipitate included in pediatric MTP packs?",
      "answer": "Cryoprecipitate (1 pooled unit) is thawed immediately after MTP activation and issued when ready. For <25 kg patients, it's included starting with Pack 1. For ≥25 kg patients, it's included in Packs 1 and 2.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What laboratory tests should be sent during MTP and how frequently?",
      "answer": "Send arterial blood gas, hematocrit, electrolytes, fibrinogen, platelets, PT, and PTT. These should be monitored regularly to guide component therapy and assess electrolyte abnormalities.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the target hemoglobin levels during pediatric massive transfusion?",

      "question": "What is the treatment protocol for hyperkalemia during pediatric MTP?",
      "answer": "For hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L + ECG changes or K+ >6 mEq/L): 1) Calcium gluconate 50-100 mg/kg, 2) Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/L, 3) Insulin regular 0.1 U/kg, 4) D50 1 mL/kg.",
      "source": "Pediatric Massive Transfusion Protocol"
    },
    {
      "question": "When should sodium bicarbonate be considered and what is the pediatric dosing?",
      "answer": "Consider sodium bicarbonate for acidosis (pH <7.2). Dose: 1-2 mEq/kg/dose.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How are subsequent MTP packs requested and delivered?",
      "answer": "Pack 2 is set up immediately after Pack 1 is delivered. Subsequent packs are sent when a phone request is received, which usually occurs when previously issued products are nearly exhausted. Products are sent via pneumatic tube or runner pickup.",
      "source": "Pediatric Massive Transfusion Protocol"
    },
    {
      "question": "What steps are required to discontinue the Massive Transfusion Protocol?",
      "answer": "1) Initiating physician or designee notifies Blood Bank by phone, 2) Unused blood components should be returned immediately to the Blood Bank.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What key elements should be reviewed during the post-MTP debriefing?",
      "answer": "The initiating physician/designee and Blood Bank physician should review: 1) Any delays in receiving blood products, 2) Any issues with blood components, 3) Whether all appropriate forms and requests were completed, 4) Any improvements that can be made in the process.",
