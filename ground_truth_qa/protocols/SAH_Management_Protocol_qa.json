    "question": "What key information should be gathered for communication to the Neurosurgery Consultant when a SAH patient presents to the ED?",
    "answer": "Essential information includes: HPI (history of present illness), patient age, date/time of SAH onset or last time seen normal, history of head trauma, seizure or syncope at onset. Past medical/social history should include prior stroke/MI/PVD and cocaine use history. Clinical exam should document SAH location, presence of hydrocephalus or IVH, presence of ICH, and evidence of trauma. Required lab findings include platelet count, PT/PTT/INR, and EKG findings.",

    "question": "What are the initial studies and medications recommended for SAH patients in the ED before transfer?",
    "answer": "Initial studies: Head CT, CBC, chem 7, PT/PTT/INR, LFTs, Troponin, type and hold, EKG, CXR. Medications include: Fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg IV load or Levetiracetam (Keppra) 1g PO/IV for seizure prophylaxis. Nimodipine dosing: 60mg PO q4h for SBP≥140, 30mg for SBP 120-140, hold for SBP≤120. Consider Amicar 4g bolus and 1g/hour drip for rebleeding prevention.",

  {
    "question": "What are the blood pressure management goals and preferred agents for SAH patients?",
    "answer": "Keep SBP between ≤140 mmHg and ≥90 mmHg. For SBP control use Nicardipine drip (preferred), Clevidipine drip, or Labetalol drip. Avoid nitroprusside as it can raise ICP. For hypotension (SBP <90), use neosynephrine (phenylephrine). The goal is to prevent rebleeding while maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.",

  {
    "question": "When should mannitol or hypertonic saline be considered in SAH patients and what are the dosing guidelines?",
    "answer": "Consider for suspected elevated intracranial pressure if patient is not following commands and/or CT suggests elevated ICP. Mannitol 20% 1-1.5 g/kg bolus (100g if weight unknown) OR 30cc 23% saline (must be pushed over 10-20 minutes via central line by MD). These agents help reduce intracranial pressure and should be used judiciously based on clinical and radiographic evidence of elevated ICP.",

    "question": "What urgent stabilization measures should be taken for SAH patients admitted to the NSICU on Day 1?",
    "answer": "ABCs assessment first. Assess for emergent EVD placement (if non-command following exam). If EVD placed, give Ancef 1g prior to insertion then discontinue antibiotics. Assess for elevated ICP and consider mannitol or 23% saline as indicated. Angiogram/coiling/clipping of aneurysm should be scheduled and performed urgently. Patient must have 18 or 20 gauge arm IV; central line alone is inadequate.",

    "question": "What imaging studies are required for SAH patients and what are the timing requirements?",
    "answer": "HCT baseline with follow-up CTA should be ordered between day 5-8. This MUST BE DONE AS SOON AS PATIENT IS STABILIZED. Call neuroradiology fellow if not done timely - delay in obtaining this study must not delay angiogram/definitive aneurysm treatment. For creatinine >1.0, give Mucomyst 600mg PO BID x 2 days and HCO3 drip (3 amps NaHCO3 in 1 liter D5W at 1cc/kg/h for 1 hour before and 6 hours after CT).",

Consider D/C antiepileptics in good grade patients (Hunt-Hess 1-2) or switch to Keppra 1000mg IV BID. Start Lovenox 40mg SQ immediately after aneurysm coiling (or 48 hours after craniotomy). Daily EKG and troponin if on pressors. Start feeds per feeding protocol. If craniotomy performed, give Cefuroxime 1.5g q6h x 24h (or Vancomycin + Gentamycin if PCN allergy).",

    "question": "How should vasospasm be managed in SAH patients showing clinical deterioration?",
    "answer": "For symptomatic vasospasm: Increase IVF or albumin dosing frequency, ensure Ins ≥ Outs. Trial phenylephrine or norepinephrine to increase SBP by 20-30 mmHg, recheck exam in 20-30 minutes for improvement. Titrate pressors per exam to max BP 220/110 mmHg. Check daily EKG and troponin on pressors. Obtain HCT, CTA/CTP and schedule angiogram. Rule out other causes (hydrocephalus, seizure, metabolic issues, fever).

Perform q1 hour closed ICP checks. Check CSF cells and culture if EVD in place AND patient febrile or infection suspected. When ready to D/C EVD, give Ancef 1g IV prior to pulling.

    "answer": "For hyponatremia, ensure Ins ≥ Outs and replace salt and volume as this is most likely cerebral salt wasting. Options include salt tabs, hypertonic saline, and normal saline. For patients with chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, schedule CVVH or SLED (slow dialysis). If patient requires temperature management, assess for arctic sun if temp >38.3°C x 2 readings 2 hours apart and initiate normothermia protocol.",
