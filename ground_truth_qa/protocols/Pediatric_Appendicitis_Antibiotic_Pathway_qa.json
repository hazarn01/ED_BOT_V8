      "question": "What are the exclusion criteria for the pediatric appendicitis antibiotic protocol?",
      "answer": "Exclusion criteria include: >18 years old, previous appendectomy, pregnancy, chronic IBD, malignancy, organ transplant, and neutropenia. These exclusions ensure the protocol is used only for appropriate pediatric patients without complicating comorbidities that would require different antibiotic management strategies.",

      "answer": "For NON-allergic to penicillin: Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/dose q24h (max 2g/dose) AND Metronidazole 30mg/kg/dose IV q24h (max 1.5g/dose). For penicillin ALLERGIC: Ciprofloxacin 15mg/kg/dose IV q12h (max 400mg/dose) AND Metronidazole 30mg/kg/dose IV q24h (max 1.5g/dose). Both regimens provide broad-spectrum coverage against typical appendicitis pathogens.",

      "answer": "For a 25 kg child: If NOT allergic to penicillin: Cefoxitin 40mg/kg/dose IV = 1000mg unless ceftriaxone given within prior 8h. If allergic to penicillin: Ciprofloxacin 15mg/kg/dose IV = 375mg if >12h from prior dose. Operative dosing should be given within 60 minutes prior to incision (cefoxitin) or within 120 minutes prior to incision (ciprofloxacin).",

      "answer": "Pain management options include: Acetaminophen 10mg/kg/dose PO/PR q4h (max 650g/dose), Ketorolac 0.5mg/kg/dose IV q6h max 30g x 20 doses, and Morphine 0.05mg/kg/dose IV q4h prn (max 1-2g/dose). Multimodal pain management is preferred to optimize comfort while minimizing opioid requirements.",

      "answer": "After appendectomy, if perforation is identified during surgery, the patient should follow the perforated appendicitis algorithm on page 2. If no perforation is found, the patient can be discharged home with appropriate follow-up. The surgical finding of perforation determines the antibiotic duration and monitoring requirements.",

If allergic: Ciprofloxacin 15mg/kg IV q12h = 300mg (max 400mg/dose) AND Metronidazole as above. Alternative: Piperacillin/tazobactam 80 mg/kg IV q 8h = 1600mg (max 3g/dose).",

All criteria must be satisfied for safe discharge. If criteria aren't met, continue IV antibiotics and reassess.",

Continue antibiotics for total of 7d if no abscess, or 14d if abscess was present. Total antibiotic duration depends on presence of abscess.",

      "question": "When should drains be placed and managed in pediatric patients with perforated appendicitis?",
      "answer": "Drainability assessment: Surgery should determine if drainage is needed for IR (interventional radiology). If indeterminate on ultrasound, consider CT. Consult Child Life prior to drainage and prior to drain removal. Drains should be managed by monitoring output (<0.5 ml/kg/day is criteria for removal). Remove drain when DC criteria are met and output is minimal.",

For perforated: Complete prescribed antibiotics (7d total if no abscess, 14d if abscess present), Pediatric Surgery Telehealth appointment on last day of antibiotics. Special notes: May discharge home with drain if other criteria met, do not repeat CBC.",
