Circulation: Hypotension (SBP<90 for adults). Signs of poor perfusion in children. Blood pressure is an unreliable indicator of shock in children; tachycardia and signs of poor perfusion may be seen prior to BP changes in children.",

      "answer": "Patients with severe traumatic injuries presenting to MSQ ED will be stabilized and transferred to Mount Sinai St. Luke's (MSSL) or Elmhurst Medical Center if the injury requires the services of a 911 designated higher-level Trauma Center.

      "answer": "Adult trauma patients should be admitted to a surgical service unless the ED attending in consultation with the surgical and/or medical service(s) determines that trauma is a secondary problem and that a medical service is most appropriate. Medicine is available to follow patients as a consult service. Pediatric trauma patients should be admitted to the PICU unless the ED attending determines another service is most appropriate.",
