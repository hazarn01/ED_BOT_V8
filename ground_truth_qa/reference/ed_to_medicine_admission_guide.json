      "question": "What key tests and documentation must be completed before placing an admit order?",
      "answer": "Labs/tests that could affect triage (ADS vs Teaching vs MPCU) must be resulted. The free text portion of the provider note must contain sufficient information for the MAPA to triage without a phone call. Include important updates (e.g., CTA negative for PE) and reason for admission. Sign out if not completed by end of your shift.",

      "question": "What is the proper communication protocol with MAPA during Medicine admissions?",
      "answer": "For Medicine admissions: Don't call the MAPA directly. However, you should answer focused questions if MAPA calls you. The MAPA will use your .EDADMIT note and completed provider documentation to perform triage. Ensure your documentation is sufficient for MAPA to triage without needing a phone call.",
