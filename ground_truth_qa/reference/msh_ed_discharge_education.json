      "question": "What is the proper sequence for nurses when conducting the AVS review with patients?",
      "answer": "Nurses should first print the AVS once ambulance arrives or the green discharge order appears if no transport needed. Then conduct review of the AVS with the patient, reviewing discharge instructions entered by the provider. If questions arise or instructions are incomplete, huddle with provider. Lab and Radiology results are printed with the AVS, and patients should be referred to MyChart for additional information.",

      "question": "What critical rule must be followed regarding patient room status during discharge?",
      "answer": "Do not room the patient in 'Discharge' status until the RN has completed their discharge process. The provider should not room the patient in 'Discharge' as this will falsely signal to the BA that the visit is ready to be closed. Only the discharging RN should room the patient in 'Discharge' after they review the AVS with the patient.",

    {

    {
      "question": "What MyChart education should be provided to patients during discharge?",
      "answer": "Patients should be reminded that their test results are available in MyChart. The discharge paperwork includes a MyChart activation code. If patients request additional information about their stay beyond what's in the AVS, they should be referred to MyChart. The BA collects the patient's email address for MyChart registration automessage during the discharge process.",
