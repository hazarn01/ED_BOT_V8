# PRP-39: Fix Frontend Mock Response Issue

## Problem
The frontend is showing hardcoded test responses instead of real medical content because:
1. The mock test server was running and serving hardcoded responses
2. After stopping it, the real API server has issues connecting to GPT-OSS/vLLM
3. The query processor fails to initialize due to missing LLM backend

## Solution
Create a temporary medical mock response system that:
1. Returns realistic medical content instead of "test response"  
2. Matches the format expected by the frontend
3. Works without requiring the LLM server to be running
4. Can be easily replaced with real LLM responses later

## Implementation
1. Stop the mock test server ✅
2. Fix GPT-OSS client initialization errors ✅
3. Add missing vllm_base_url setting ✅
4. Create medical-specific mock responses for development ⏳
5. Verify frontend displays real medical content ⏳

## Status: IN PROGRESS
