# Criteria for Dysphagia Screening

## Overview
This document outlines the criteria and protocol for performing dysphagia screening in patients to identify those at risk for aspiration and swallowing difficulties. Early identification of dysphagia is crucial to prevent aspiration pneumonia and ensure appropriate nutritional support.

## Indications for Dysphagia Screening

Mandatory dysphagia screening should be conducted for all patients with:

1. **Acute Stroke**:
   - All patients with suspected or confirmed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke
   - TIA patients with any bulbar symptoms
   - Screening should be completed before any oral intake

2. **Neurological Conditions**:
   - Decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15)
   - Cranial nerve deficits affecting swallowing (CN IX, X, XII)
   - Progressive neurological disorders (Parkinson's, ALS, MS)
   - Brain tumors affecting swallowing centers
   - Recent intubation > 48 hours for neurological conditions

3. **Head and Neck Conditions**:
   - Head and neck cancer or history of radiation to neck
   - Recent oropharyngeal surgery
   - Facial or neck trauma
   - Tracheostomy (new or established)

4. **Other High-Risk Conditions**:
   - Age > 80 years with acute illness requiring hospitalization
   - History of aspiration pneumonia
   - COPD exacerbation with respiratory distress
   - Severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization
   - ICU admission with prolonged intubation (> 48 hours)

## Screening Protocol

### Initial Nurse Assessment
1. **Patient Alertness Check**:
   - Patient must be alert and able to follow commands
   - If patient fails alertness check, NPO status should be maintained and physician notified

2. **Pre-Screening Assessment**:
   - Assess voice quality (wet/gurgling voice)
   - Assess voluntary cough strength
   - Assess ability to manage secretions
   - Assess tongue movement and strength
   - If any abnormalities noted, proceed with caution

### 3-Oz Water Swallow Test
1. Have patient sit upright at minimum 60-degree angle
2. Administer 3 oz of water in a cup (if patient can hold) or via spoon if necessary
3. Instruct patient to drink the entire amount continuously
4. Observe for:
   - Coughing during or within 1 minute after swallowing
   - Wet/gurgling voice after swallowing
   - Multiple swallows per bolus
   - Delayed swallow (> 2 seconds)
   - Incomplete oral clearance
   - Drooling or loss of liquid from mouth

### Documentation
Document the following in the patient's chart:
- Date and time of screening
- Results of screening (Pass/Fail)
- Specific observations
- Recommendations for further evaluation if screening failed
- Recommended diet consistency if screening passed

## Screening Outcomes

### Failed Screening (Positive for Dysphagia)
If ANY of the following are observed:
- Coughing during or after swallowing
- Wet/gurgling voice after swallowing
- Multiple swallows needed per bolus
- Significant delay in initiating swallow

Actions:
1. Keep patient NPO
2. Place appropriate dysphagia precaution signage
3. Notify physician
4. Order Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) consultation
5. Consider alternative feeding methods if prolonged NPO status anticipated

### Passed Screening (Negative for Dysphagia)
If NONE of the above signs are observed:

Actions:
1. Start regular diet as appropriate for medical condition
2. Monitor for any signs of aspiration with meals
3. Implement dysphagia precautions as needed:
   - Upright position for meals and 30 minutes after
   - Supervised meals for at-risk patients
   - Appropriate food texture modifications if indicated

## Quality Measures
- Dysphagia screening should be completed within 24 hours of admission for all stroke patients
- Documentation of screening must be completed in the designated area of the EMR
- Compliance with dysphagia screening protocol should be audited quarterly
