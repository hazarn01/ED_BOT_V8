```

## Architecture Overview

### Query Processing Pipeline
The system processes medical queries through a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Classification** (`src/pipeline/classifier.py`)
   - Hybrid approach: rule-based patterns + LLM classification
   - 6 query types: CONTACT, FORM, PROTOCOL, CRITERIA, DOSAGE, SUMMARY
   - Target >90% accuracy with confidence scoring

2. **Routing** (`src/pipeline/router.py`)
   - Routes classified queries to appropriate retrieval strategy
   - Type-specific handlers for each query category
   - Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

3. **Response Generation** (`src/pipeline/response_formatter.py`)
   - Format responses with preserved citations
   - Medical safety validation
   - HIPAA-compliant PHI scrubbing

### Core Services

**API Layer** (`src/api/`)
- FastAPI application on port 8001
- Async endpoints with dependency injection
- PDF serving with authentication
- Health checks and monitoring

**LLM Integration** (`src/ai/`)
- Primary: GPT-OSS 20B via vLLM (local GPU inference)
- Fallback: Azure OpenAI or Ollama
- Medical-specific prompts with safety guardrails
- Temperature=0 for deterministic medical responses

**Data Layer** (`src/models/`)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search
- SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations
- Pydantic schemas for validation
- Document registry with metadata tracking

**Caching** (`src/cache/`)
- Redis with query-type-specific TTL policies
- Never cache FORM queries (always fresh PDFs)
- 5-minute TTL for most query types

### Query Type Details

Each query type has specific handling requirements:

**CONTACT_LOOKUP**: Mock Amion integration for on-call schedules
**FORM_RETRIEVAL**: Direct PDF serving, no caching, authentication required
**PROTOCOL_STEPS**: Clinical protocols with timing, contacts, medications
**CRITERIA_CHECK**: Decision thresholds with citations
**DOSAGE_LOOKUP**: Medication dosing with safety validation
**SUMMARY_REQUEST**: Multi-source synthesis with confidence scores

## Critical Implementation Rules

### Medical Safety
- **Never guess medical information** - only use verified protocols
- **Always preserve source citations** in responses
- **Validate dosages** against known safe ranges before returning
- **Include confidence scores** for all medical recommendations
- **Flag low-confidence answers** with explicit warnings

### HIPAA Compliance
- `LOG_SCRUB_PHI=true` - Remove PHI from all logs
- `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_CALLS=true` - No external API calls for inference
- Local LLM only - No data leaves the infrastructure
- Audit trail for all medical queries
- Secure PDF serving with authentication

### Performance Requirements
- Response time: <1.5s for non-LLM queries
- Classification accuracy: >90% on test suite
- Citation preservation: 100% requirement
- PDF availability: Must return actual files, never descriptions

## Testing Strategy

### Primary Test Queries
These must always pass:
```python
# Protocol with timing and contacts
"what is the ED STEMI protocol"

# Form returning actual PDF  
"show me the blood transfusion form"

# Contact with current on-call
"who is on call for cardiology"
```

### Test Execution
```bash
# After any code changes
make test-unit              # Fast unit tests
make test-integration       # API and database tests
make test-all              # Full suite with linting

# Manual query testing
make query-test            # Test all 6 query types
```

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Medical Protocols
1. Add PDF to `docs/protocols/`
2. Update `scripts/seed_documents.py` with metadata
3. Run `make seed` to update database
4. Test with `make query-test`

### Modifying Database Schema
1. Edit models in `src/models/entities.py`
2. Generate migration: `make migrate`
3. Review migration in `alembic/versions/`
4. Apply: `make upgrade`

### Debugging Query Classification
1. Check patterns in `src/pipeline/classifier.py:_compile_classification_patterns()`
2. Use `get_classification_explanation()` for debugging
3. Add test cases to `tests/unit/test_classifier.py`
4. Verify with actual queries via API

## Environment Configuration

Key settings in `EDBOTv8.env.example`:
```bash
# LLM Backend Selection
LLM_BACKEND=ollama  # gpt-oss | ollama | azure
VLLM_BASE_URL=http://llm:8000
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral:7b-instruct

# HIPAA Compliance (DO NOT CHANGE)
DISABLE_EXTERNAL_CALLS=true
LOG_SCRUB_PHI=true

# Performance Tuning
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300
MAX_WORKERS=4
```

## Important Notes

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ All core components implemented
- ✅ 6-type query classification working
- ✅ Medical safety validation active
- ✅ PDF serving functional
- ✅ Mock contact service ready
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

### Medical Domain Context
- 414 medical abbreviations tracked in `medical_abbreviations.json`
- Protocol timing critical (e.g., STEMI <90min door-to-balloon)
- Phone format validation: xxx-xxx-xxxx
- Pager format validation: numeric only
- Form paths must be absolute for PDF serving

### Never Do
- Remove source citations from responses
- Cache FORM query results
- Use external APIs for medical inference
- Log PHI or patient information
- Guess at medical dosages or protocols
- Create new medical content without verification

## Memory

This is the first time running the application.
