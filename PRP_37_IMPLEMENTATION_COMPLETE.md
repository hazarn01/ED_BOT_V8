## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Query Processing Flow:
1. **Cache Check** → No cached result
2. **Meta Query Check** → Not a meta query  
3. **🆕 Curated Response Check** → **Match found with 93.3% confidence**
4. **✅ Return curated response** (skip classification & routing)
5. **Cache result** for future requests

### Fallback Behavior:
- If curated match score < 60% → Continue to classification & RAG
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility
- Zero disruption to existing functionality

### Source Format Compliance:
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "display_name": "STEMI Activation Protocol 2024", 
      "filename": "STEMI_Activation_Protocol_2024.pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```
