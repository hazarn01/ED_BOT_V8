    query="What is the STEMI protocol?",
    documents=[stemi_doc],
    use_hybrid=True
)
```

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python test_hybrid_rag.py

# Expected results:
# - Fact extraction: 5-15 facts per query
# - Processing time: 2-5 seconds
# - Confidence improvement: +0.05-0.15
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment (1-2 months)

            token="your-hf-token"
        )
    
    async def extract_facts(self, prompt):
        return await self.client.text_generation(prompt)
```

### Phase 3: Optimization (1-2 months)

    torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # Half precision
    device_map="auto"
)

# Compile model for faster inference
model = torch.compile(model)
```

#### Caching Strategy

# Cache T5 results for common queries
class FactExtractionCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
    
    async def get_or_extract(self, query_hash, documents):
        if query_hash in self.cache:
            return self.cache[query_hash]
        
        facts = await self.extract_facts(documents)
