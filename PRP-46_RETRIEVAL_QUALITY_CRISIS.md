# PRP-46: RETRIEVAL QUALITY CRISIS INVESTIGATION

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Despite successful technical integration of BM25 scoring, medical synonym expansion, and multi-source retrieval, the actual answer quality has **catastrophically degraded**. The system is returning completely irrelevant responses:

### EVIDENCE OF FAILURE

| Query | Expected | Actual Response | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| "STEMI protocol" | STEMI medical protocol | Query processor enhancement documentation | 0% |
| "Blood transfusion form" | Transfusion consent form | Pediatric sepsis training | 0% |
| "Sepsis criteria" | Lactate thresholds | Pediatric triage documentation | 20% |
| "L&D clearance" | Labor & delivery clearance | Dysphagia screening | 0% |
| "PACS loading" | PACS system info | Ollama integration docs | 0% |

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS

Our testing methodology was **fundamentally flawed**:

1. **API-only testing**: We tested curl responses but didn't validate actual frontend behavior
2. **Metrics-focused**: We measured source count but not content relevance
3. **Technical validation**: We confirmed components worked but not that they worked correctly
4. **Sample bias**: We tested with queries that accidentally matched our seeded content

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Document Quality Problem
The system is retrieving development documentation (`PHASE_4_CONTEXT_ENHANCEMENT.md`, `OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md`) instead of medical protocols. This suggests:
- Wrong documents are being indexed as high-relevance
- BM25 scoring is boosting irrelevant technical documentation
- Medical content filtering is broken

### 2. Query Classification Failure
- "Blood transfusion form" → Returns pediatric sepsis (wrong medical domain)
- "L&D clearance" → Returns dysphagia screening (completely unrelated)
- Query-type routing is malfunctioning

### 3. Medical Synonym Expansion Gone Wrong
The 6-7 synonym expansions may be **diluting** the query rather than enhancing it:
- Original precise medical terms get lost in expansion
- Generic medical terms match irrelevant documents
- BM25 scoring becomes confused by too many terms

### 4. Multi-Source Retrieval Amplifying Bad Results
Instead of finding 3-5 good sources, we're finding 5 irrelevant sources and presenting them as authoritative medical information.

## INVESTIGATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Diagnostic
1. **Compare Before/After**: Test the same queries against the basic system without enhancements
2. **Document Analysis**: Examine what documents are actually in the database
3. **BM25 Score Analysis**: Check what scores irrelevant documents are getting
4. **Query Expansion Impact**: Test with/without synonym expansion

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis  
1. **Database Content Audit**: Verify medical vs non-medical document ratios
2. **Relevance Scoring Debug**: Trace why development docs score higher than medical protocols
3. **Classification Logic Review**: Examine why query routing is failing
4. **Search Term Analysis**: Understand how expanded queries are being processed

### Phase 3: Quality Recovery
1. **Medical Document Prioritization**: Ensure medical PDFs are weighted higher than markdown files
2. **Query Expansion Refinement**: Limit or improve synonym expansion
3. **Relevance Threshold**: Add minimum relevance thresholds to filter out irrelevant results
4. **Content Type Filtering**: Prioritize actual medical protocols over documentation

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Disable Enhanced Mode**: Temporarily revert to basic retrieval to restore baseline functionality
2. **Content Audit**: Identify what non-medical content is polluting the medical database
3. **Test Suite Overhaul**: Create frontend-based tests that catch relevance failures
4. **Quality Metrics**: Implement relevance scoring that measures actual answer quality

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Technical Success ≠ User Success**: All components working doesn't mean the system works
2. **Testing Must Match Usage**: API testing missed frontend presentation issues
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: 5 irrelevant sources are worse than 1 relevant source
4. **Domain Specificity Critical**: Medical systems require strict relevance filtering

This represents a critical failure in our enhancement approach. The system is now **worse than before** despite successful technical implementation.

## PRIORITY: URGENT
The system is providing medically irrelevant information in a clinical context. This must be fixed immediately.
